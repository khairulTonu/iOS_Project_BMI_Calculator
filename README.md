# iOS_Project_BMI_Calculator

Here is my simple iOS application based Body Mass Index(BMI). Standard Body Mass Index calculator. Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
The app will take input height and weight and then show the result that the user is normal/overweighted/underweighed.
